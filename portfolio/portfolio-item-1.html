                <p>With drop, we are redefining the art of discovery. When we connect travelers with experts, the travelers can feel a sense of both spontaneity and ownership in what they find: the local, hidden gems.
We want to capture the real interaction which isn’t with the UI — it’s with the city, with strangers, with friends, with those special memories tied that that special place.

Drop brings information to the user without overwhelming the user. She can find a treasure without even looking for it!

                     <section class="lead"><h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We chose Drop during our brainstorming because its a different way of thinking
about smartwatch apps, and targets a very interesting market - connecting urban traveler and local expert on the go: <br />

                <p>We extensively applied master apprenticeship model, throughout the search process. Based on our contextual inquiries, we distilled our MVP to cater to the following findings:
<img src="img/drop/ux.jpg"  alt=""> </p>
<p>We conducted 6 contextual inquiries, usability tests for 40 participants, and performed competitive analysis for 6 competitors</p>
<p>We experienced the following design challenges - (A) Designing for watch's small form factor and (B) Creating seamless interactions from watch to smartphone.
Iteration made a huge difference in our visual design and interactions. </p>
<p>Drop started out looking more like an app for navigation than one for social and sharing. It also lacked a modern design aesthetic.
In our first redesign, we focused on the latter, and upgraded to <strong>material design</strong>. But we still found Drop’s phone UI clunky to navigate, with too many screens and steps to get to the key feature of the phone — sharing.
In our second major redesign, we pivoted on the <strong>functionality</strong>, opting to focus on visual media rather than text, thereby simplifying the app immensely. We also used a mode switch to help people distinguish between sharing with friends and sharing with the public, instead of complicated picking and choosing.
And, we updated our <strong>privacy settings</strong> to use usernames and pictures, rather than anonymity for more accountability in public drops.
