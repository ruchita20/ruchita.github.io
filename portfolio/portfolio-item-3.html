                <p>The map tells you which tracks and artists are top-ranked across the world. Exploring further will uncover top trending charts for each city. As much as it is a delight for music fans, music trend analysts and event organizers may also find this useful in understanding consumption patterns globally.</p>

                     <section class="lead"><h3>Process</h3>
                <p>With the abundance of available music, discovering music is a difficult task. Music Map helps enhance your experience of discovering popular and trending music worldwide. We started by creating user research and competitive analysis for our web app. We created the following paper prototypes:<br />
                <img src="img/musicmap/3.jpg"  alt=""><br/>
                  <img src="img/musicmap/4.jpg"  alt=""><br/>
                    <img src="img/musicmap/5.jpg"  alt=""><br/>
                      <img src="img/musicmap/6.jpg"  alt="">
                  </p> 
                
                
                <p>For Music Map, we use various APIs from different partners; so making these resources talk to each other without causing major interoperability issues was a big challenge. Also, the resource descriptions across various music APIs was non-uniform. We had to deal with classifying the interactions in order to visualize the music data across different geographical regions. For this classification, we explored various linked data sets and resource description frameworks to adopt the metadata from these sets. </p>
