                <p>BrunchBox is geared toward those who need a quick and simple way to keep track of relevant businesses in multiple locations. BrunchBox takes a user's location and uses the Yelp API to filter out all the brunch areas near the user and presents a simple to use visualization (computed based on distance and Yelp ratings).</p>

                     <section class="lead"><h3>Process</h3>
                <p>This was a Information Organization Lab course project, where we worked to create a fun web app for solving a common issue that we faced - <strong>Finding good brunch places quickly</strong>.
                
                  </p> 
                  <p> We had the following goals in mind when preparing for the usability and needs assessment:

<ul><li>Investigate issues that users face while searching for local brunch places</li>
<li>Determine the decision making costs for users</li>
</ul>
       </p>
                
                
                <p>While creating our interactive prototype, we had to balance the complexity of implementing our visualization algorithm in D3.JS and also focus on presenting a consistent narrative style. We reiterated on our low fidelity designs several times before arriving at our final design that could be easily developed in an engaging narrative:<br/>
                <img src="./img/brunchbox/2.jpg"> </p>
                      <p>
                      As a group we learned more about visualizing and exploring consumer behaviours and search patterns. We also learned about creating engaging user experiences by simplifying cost of decision making.</p>
