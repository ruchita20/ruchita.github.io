                    <section class="lead"><h3>About</h3>
                <p>This was a course project for Information Visualization class, where we worked with data wrangling and analysis for decade old data on crime statistics against Women in India.   </p>
                     </section>
                     <section class="lead">
                     <h3>Process</h3>
                     <p>To  confirm user needs and validation of the developed product, we completed the following:
                     <ul><li>Designed an online survey with 30 respondents</li>
                     <li>Outreached to rule of communities across the world for telephonic interviews</li>
                     <li>Conducted usability testing for 8 participants</li>
                     <li>Performed competitive analysis modeling of 2 competitors</li></ul>
                     </p>
                <p>
                
                We had the following goals in mind when preparing for the usability and needs assessment:
                <ul><li>Investigate factors that deter the end users from engaging with INPROL</li>
                <li>Identify channel partnerships for INPROL to increase their user base</li>
                
                </ul>

                  </p> 
                
                
                <p>We collaborated with INPROL users (remotely located in <strong>post conflict and developing countries</strong> like Afghanistan), channel partners from <strong>US Army</strong>, <strong>federal law enforcement agencies worldwide</strong>, etc. We outreached online to obtain survey and interview responses. We learned the motivations and deterrents as to why people engage with the INPROL platform. To deep further, we asked about their content sharing concerns (especially in war zone states).   
                </p>
                <p>We created average completion times metrics to quantitatively evaluate user experiences:<br>

                <p>We also performed heuristic evaluation to uncover usability issues with the platform: <br>

                 <p>We created user personas to present user experience issues:
