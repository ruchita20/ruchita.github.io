                    <section class="lead"><h3>About</h3>
                <p>Designed and developed social bookmarking application for ownCloud, Inc. as part of my internship with GNOME Foundation. Selected from more than thousands of applicants globally to join GNOME's Outreach Program for Women to commit to open source development.</p>
                     </section>
                     <section class="lead"><h3>Process</h3>
                <p>I started with user research based on a relatively high level concept provided by my mentors at ownCloud. To  confirm user needs and validation of the developed product, I completed the following:
                <ul><li>Performed competitive analysis modeling of 6 competitors</li>
                <li>Conducted requirements analysis by working with ownCloud's product designers, developers, and partners</li>
                
                </ul>

                  </p> 
                
                
                <p>I had the following goals in mind when preparing for the usability and needs assessment:
                <ul><li> Investigate factors that motivate or deter people from bookmarking content on ownCloud infrastructure</li>
                <li>Determine what attributes of a social bookmarking are most engaging for the users</li>
                </ul>
                I collaborated with product designers and developers over IRC channels to drive requirements towards a MVP using wireframes and paper prototypes. Iterating over these prototypes in git issues made a huge difference in improving the overall interactions.
