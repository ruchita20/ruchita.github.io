                <p>This was a Needs and Usability Assessment course project, where we worked with a third party client, <strong>United States Initiatives of Peace's organization INPROL</strong>. The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) is a global, online community of law practitioners from 300 organizations. Members come from a range of relevant disciplines and backgrounds to work on rule of law reform issues in post-conflict and developing countries, from a policy-, practice- or research-perspective.  </p>

                     <h3>Process</h3>
                     <p>To  confirm user needs and validation of the developed product, we completed the following:
                     <ul><li>Designed an online survey with 30 respondents</li>
                     <li>Outreached to rule of communities across the world for telephonic interviews</li>
                     <li>Conducted usability testing for 8 participants</li>
                     <li>Performed competitive analysis modeling of 2 competitors</li></ul>
                     </p>
                <p>
                
                We had the following goals in mind when preparing for the usability and needs assessment:
                <ul><li>Investigate factors that deter the end users from engaging with INPROL</li>
                <li>Identify channel partnerships for INPROL to increase their user base</li>
                
                </ul>

                  </p> 
                
                
                <p>We collaborated with INPROL users (remotely located in <strong>post conflict and developing countries</strong> like Afghanistan), channel partners from <strong>US Army</strong>, <strong>federal law enforcement agencies worldwide</strong>, etc. We outreached online to obtain survey and interview responses. We learned the motivations and deterrents as to why people engage with the INPROL platform. To deep further, we asked about their content sharing concerns (especially in war zone states).   
                </p>
                <p>We created average completion times metrics to quantitatively evaluate user experiences:<br>

                <p>We also performed heuristic evaluation to uncover usability issues with the platform: <br>

                 <p>We created user personas to present user experience issues:
